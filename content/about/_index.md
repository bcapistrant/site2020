title: Multiple Regression
---

The formal course description of this course is:

> Theory and applications of regression techniques; linear and nonlinear multiple regression models, residual and influence analysis, correlation, covariance analysis, indicator variables and time series analysis. This course includes methods for choosing, fitting, evaluating and comparing statistical models and analyzes data sets taken from the natural, physical and social sciences. Prerequisite: introductory statistics or 4+ on the AP Statistics Exam.

Students who have taken any college-level introductory statistics course are eligible to take this course. We assume an understanding of basic principles and statistical tests covered in any such course. The course prioritizes more time working with real data and fewer formal mathematical proofs to understand regression modelling. We use the `R` programming language and `RStudio` to practice fitting regression models, evaluating regression assumptions, and creating and understanding data visualizations in the context of regression modelling.

This course is a core course for the SDS major and minor, and for the applied statistics track of the Mathematics/ Statistics major. For more information on how this course fits in the SDS major, check the ![SDS website](https://www.smith.edu/academics/statistics).
